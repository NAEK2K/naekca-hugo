# My Skills

**Web Development**

Web development is easily my favorite field of development. I have used **JavaScript**, **NodeJS**, and **ReactJS** extensively to develop personal side-projects, as well as using it for assignments in my web development course at university. I'm familiar with a broad range of tools used in web development due to my curiosity with the field!

**Software Development**

I have prior experience developing software in **C**, **C++**, **Java**, and **Python**. I enjoy getting the opportunity to work in software development due to the contrast it has with web development while also sharing many similarities.

**Databases**

I am familiar with working in both **SQL** and **NoSQL** environments due to work I have done in my courses as well as integrating databases into my side-projects. I have used **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, **MySQL**, and **MariaDB** throughout the years.

**Operating Systems**

I have used both **Windows** and **Linux** in both desktop and server environments. I have a soft spot for Linux due to the built-in package managers and simplicity of use but I primarily use Windows for my personal computers.

# My Side-Projects

- A stock tracker app built in NodeJS and ReactJS that supports multiple users to keep track of their portfolios.

**Todo List** [GitHub](https://github.com/naek2k/todo-list)
