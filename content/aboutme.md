# What's this?

I didn't want to flood my home page with details about myself so I'm going to put more stuff about me here!

# Quick facts about me!

- I can type up to 145 WPM
- I used to run game servers when I was younger
- I run one of the largest computer science communities at Carleton
- I love having a cup of coffee in the morning
- I have a cat and a dog
- I've never had real pop, only diet drinks

# What are my hobbies?

One of my favorite things to do is play video games, specifically ones with a competitive scene attached to them. Recently I have been getting into playing single player story games which have been a nice change of scenery from the exhaustive nature of playing competitively. Games that I have been playing recently are Valorant, CS:GO, League of Legends, and Yakuza 0!

I feel having a good balance on and off the computer is important so another favorite of mine is weight lifting! It helped me have a healthier life style in high school and I've stuck with it ever since then. My current maxes are a 405lb deadlift, 255lb bench press, and 275lb squat!

Apart from those two, I enjoy mechanical keyboards and headphones. First time I used a mechanical keyboard was life changing and ever since then I've made sure I have a nice platform for my typing! It's a fun hobby due to the customizability of your keyboard, whether it's the key caps or switches. My love for headphones came when Amazon had a sale on Sennheiser HD598 SE's which was an affordable gateway into a very expensive hobby.

# What editor do I use?

After using many different editors over the years, I think I finally settled on my "forever" editor, and that would be [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I use the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font with ligatures and the [Horizon](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jolaleye.horizon-theme-vscode) color theme (dark theme of course). Easy on my eyes and looks pretty!

I'll be updating this page over time, thanks for checking it out :D
