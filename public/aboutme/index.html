<h1 id="what-are-my-hobbies">What are my hobbies?<a href="#what-are-my-hobbies" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>One of my favorite things to do is play video games, specifically ones with a competitive scene attached to them. Recently I have been getting into playing single player story games which have been a nice change of scenery from the exhaustive nature of playing competitively. Games that I have been playing recently are Valorant, CS:GO, League of Legends, and Yakuza 0!</p>
<p>I feel having a good balance on and off the computer is important so another favorite of mine is weight lifting! It helped me have a healthier life style in high school and I&rsquo;ve stuck with it ever since then. My current maxes are a 405lb deadlift, 255lb bench press, and 275lb squat!</p>
<p>Apart from those two, I enjoy mechanical keyboards and headphones. First time I used a mechanical keyboard was life changing and ever since then I&rsquo;ve made sure I have a nice platform for my typing! It&rsquo;s a fun hobby due to the customizability of your keyboard, whether it&rsquo;s the key caps or switches. My love for headphones came when Amazon had a sale on Sennheiser HD598 SE&rsquo;s which was an affordable gateway into a very expensive hobby.</p>
<h1 id="what-editor-do-i-use">What editor do I use?<a href="#what-editor-do-i-use" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>After using many different editors over the years, I think I finally settled on my &ldquo;forever&rdquo; editor, and that would be <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>. I use the <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</a> font with ligatures and the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jolaleye.horizon-theme-vscode">Horizon</a> color theme (dark theme of course). Easy on my eyes and looks pretty!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be updating this page over time, thanks for checking it out :D</p>
